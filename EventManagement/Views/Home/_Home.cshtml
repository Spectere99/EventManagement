            <i>Recently the BSA has made a change in policy to when girls can start the cub scout program. Instead of starting in August girls can now register and start in cub scouts in June. The Day camp staff has been hard at work working with council on finding out the new rules and implementing them into our day camp for 2018.  Due to these changes, We are pleased to announce that the York District Cub Scout Day Camp can accept girls at the 2018 Cub Scout Day Camp as long as they are registered members of the BSA. The girls will need to register for day camp online by May 18th. Due to the last minute change by the BSA our website is not able to identify genders of scouts. Please include in the notes section that the scout is a girl when creating the child account.Please contact the Day Camp Director Danny Culver for more information and questions on how the girl registration for camp is going to work. The May 18th deadline is the final deadline for all scouts to register for York District Cub Scout Day Camp.  We hope you understand as we strive to meet the needs of all our scouting youth. </i><hr />
            Volunteers may receive 1 staff shirt at no cost. Additional shirts are $10 each. Everyone must bring their own lunch for each day.  Lunch will not be provided.
            5-Day Volunteers who attend and complete all mandatory training will receive a $25 refund on their scout’s registration at the end of Cub Scout Day Camp.
